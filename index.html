      <h1>Happy birthday</h1>
      <p>Hi Dad. Happy birthday. Hope you have had a good day. Acacia is now walking all over the place as you would have seen from Weechat. Life is getting busy now with a house, job & baby. Being a father you begin to appreciate all the work your own parents must have done in raising you up. Life is full of complications, so many things to take care of, so many things to consider and yet in the midst of it all, we can enjoy the Lord.</p>
<p>
We enjoyed the time you and Basia came to visit us in Paraparaumu. Sorry we kinda put you to work, getting you to help with the insulation, Basia helping us with weeding of the garden, and getting you to look at the shower ventallation. We look forward to more visits in the future :)

      <h3>Visit last year</h3>
      <p>We also very much enjoyed the time we spent at the end of last year in Tauranga. I was educated very much on politics and the infamous sea lettuce. We enjoyed going to the mountain, walks by the beach, and just being together. Look forward to more time soon.</p>
